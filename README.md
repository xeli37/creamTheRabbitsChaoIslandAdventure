this is a WIP sonic fangame based on the sonic adventure's chao gardens
this game will center cream the rabbit as she builds a habitable chao island to raise her own lil buddies <3\
\
planned features:\
	- chao raising, evolving, breeding, and all other related mechanics\
	- farming & creafting to raise rings for supplies\
	- all mechanics from sonic adventure chao gardens (race, karate, school, alignment gardens, etc)\
	- custom garden decoration\
	\
advanced features hoping to implement:\
	- easy modding (maps, chao, toys, etc)\
	- custom chao garden creatoin in-game?\
	- multiplayer with chao trading and interaction\
		- probably allow players to bring 1 chao while visiting others. chao can breed, play, and perhaps learn things from each other\
		\
i am open to more ideas and any assistance with development. thanks for checking this out!\
